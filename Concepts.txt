Procedural Roguelike (duh)

Main Thoughts:

Procedural dungeons
Procedural main map (possibly save a particular one and keep it as is)

Main Map:
wandering enemies - on touch start combat (go to new screen)
wandering caravans
dungeons randomly spread - 


Dungeons:
some goal in each dungeon (collect __, kill __, save __, retrieve ___, deliver ___, etc.)
quests?
dungeons move (destroy and replace at a new tile) on completion

Towns?:
caravans and NPCs give quests
standing with people/towns/caravans (not sure how specific to be)
if by towns - size of town effects impact of morality 
(smaller town - bad decisions make people angrier faster)


Quests:
"Do [THING], at [PLACE] in [DURATION?]"
thing - quest type + quest objective 
place - dungeon/part of world map 

Gameplay:



Grinding:
there is ALWAYS better gear. ALWAYS.


RPG elements:
Stats
Gear



Combat:
elona-esque
melee + range + magic + throwing
we want throwing to be busted af (possibly ludicrously small chance of decap)


CONTROLS (fuck that):
options are pretty much:
dpad 
best atm - touch in direction of movement
drag
tap destination
